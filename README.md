# Three-Body-Problem
A simulation of the three body problem (the orbits of three celestial bodies) given initial conditions of mass, speed, and position

## Initial conditions
```
# Indices indicate 0: 'Sun;, 1: 'Earth', 2: 'Moon'
masses = [3.0, 0.01, 0.0001]
Vx = [0, 0, 0]
Vy = [0, 0.5477, 0.6891]
x = [0, 10, 10.5]
y = [0, 0, 0]
```
